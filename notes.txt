1) - Django has a built in ORM and the object is a object relational mapper 
2) - It's a bascially a system whereby it abstarcts away the complexities of interacting with the SQL database and the ORM allows 
us to basically write python code which in turn can interact with the SQL database all on its own.
3) - What happens when we have those SQL code made by python or made by Django ?
ANS: We need to do is that we need to instruct the Django framework that, hey, the migrationsthat have been made, you need to apply 
these to database so that the database typically updates the schema and knows how to interact with our application.

4) - A migration is basically the python code that we write to interact with our database.
5) - Django Admin app or django admin clay tool is a tool that is provided to us by the django package that we install and we only use 
     that to actually start or create our initial projectand after that I just switch to using the managae that profile because it contains all
     of the functionalitythat I would require from the Django admin as well as some additional feature as well.
6) - ASGI file is bascially the file that stands for Asynchronous Server gateway Interface and it allows external applications and that act as web servers 
     to basically interactwith our Django application or service.
7) - WSGI file is use when we actually deploy our application to production.
8) - We're basically going to be doing is that we are basically going to be using the manage.py clay and we're going to be using that to be 
     basically create a super user for our application.
9) - A super user in the case just means a user which has admin privileages for our application which has a role of admin and the managed.py CLA 
     tool basically has some functionality in that allows us to do that.

***********************************************************************************************************

1) - Introduction to Django apps

          (a) - python manage.py --help
          (b) - python manage.py startapp name

          AutoMax >> settings.py 
                              INSTALLED APPS 
                                             'main',

          (c) - Now, we have successfully linked our application with Django App.

2) - Working with Django Apps  

           (a) - main > views.py
                        what we're going to be doing is that we are basically creating a view which is going to be responsible 
                        for showing our let's just say main page when we navigate to our website.
                        def landing_view(request): --->> requesting a parameter
                                                         request a object that is going to be passed to the function.
                        NOW returning as a response to this view ---->>>>
                                                                         return HttpResponse("<h1>Welcome to AutoMax!</h1>")
           (b) - AutoMax > AutoMax > urls.py
           (c) - main > new file > urls.py

3) - Django Templating

           (a) - make templates folder in main folder
           (b) - then create a main folder in template folder and then create main.html file in main folder
           (c) - write html code there.
           (d) - Now in views.py 
                                GOING to pass the object after the path of the html file which will be key value 
                                pair within it 
           (e) - now going to pass this object into main.html file

     This is one of the beautiful elements of the django Templating and that is that it allows us to dynamically 
     inject data into our html and then render that

4) - Expanding main.html template

           (a) - write some <html> header and <head> tags and write some html code like meta viewport and everything else.
           (b) - now in body section write <h1> tag 

5) - Loading Static Assets Django

           (a) - I'm going to be using to improve the stylish of our application is going to be bootstrap.
                 it's a library, which gives us access to CSS as well as some JS files that basically enhance the
                 stylish of our website.

                 go to bootstrap.com --->>> download the bootstrp c files  
                 after downloading open the directory where you are developing you website and copy the downloaded files 
                 into the directory

           (b) - go to the github repo and main>>user>>static folder copy and then paste it into 
                 your directory main >> static 
           (c) - open css folder and copy style.css file into your directory from the git hub directory of hussain
           (d) - open bootswatch.com >> download whatever theme you like and put it into the static >> css directory
           (e) - now we need to load these static files into our django application
           (f) - use templating to our advantage to basically load the static file link for this 'href=""' header
           (g) - i'll add these codes in href '{% static '' %}' 
           (h) - static lead to the static folder which Django automatically lead to this folder
           (i) - Now we need to add 'css/bootstrap.min.css' in href 
           (j) - if you run the server you will see error
           (k) - just go to main.html file add {% load static %} into the file above the code 
                 because if you want to use static keyword you have to do this.
           (l) - The reason i use static files is because i would like to package some code with our application such 
                 as CSS files or javascript files that would like to make available on the client side.
                 And these are static files that are a part of our application that we need to serve with our HTML pages.

           (m) - To do that, i'm going to use the concept of working with static files
                 with Django, where we for every app that requires acess to certain static files, we place the static files under the
                 apps folder called staticand then we basically use the static tag wherever it's necessary within our actual HTML
                 to load whatever static resources we need to load.

6) - Extending Templates and Templates Blocks

            (a) - Let's divide our templates into multiple different files and how I can basically load these files 
                  templates together or join them together upon my wish.
            (b) - I'm basically creating a base HTML template, which is going to serve as the basic template that all other
                  templates are basically going to extend upon and this is going to allow me to do is that it's going to
                  allow me the ability to bascially create these reusable pieces that  can be basically inserted into the because
                  HTML and this will become just a bit more apparent as I basically code the actual state.
            (c) - main >> template >> create new folder name it base folder and into this folder
                  create a new file base.html and load basic html tag {% load static %}
            (d) - copy all the head section of main.html to base.html file and remove it from the main.html and
                  add <!DOCTYPE html> into the base.html
            (e) - Define body tag and cut the footer tag from main.html and paste it into base.html
            (f) - Let's define a section within base.html file where we are going to be dynamically loading content from 
                  other templates and for that i'll use a concept known as blocks in templating for Django, and a block
                  is basically a certain section in our template that we can define where we basically tell django that
                  it is again going to be a template tag which is going to be blocked as denoted by this {% block %} ----
                  {% endblock %} and whatever I put within this block is going to be basically going to be input it into this 
                  template from another template that we would use and you'll see how all of these things link.
            (g) - Now we're basically going to be extending a template(base.html) in main.html that exists
            (h) - Let's define a block in base.html and footer block for the footer section
            (i) - add style.css file in base.html from static>css>style.css

7) - FINISHING MAIN PAGE HTML ----->>>>>

            (a) - I added this in main.html 

                  <header class="mb-auto">
            <div> 
                <h3 class = "float-md-start mb-0">AutoMax</h3>
                <nav class = "nav nav-masthead justify-content-center float-md-end">
                    <a class = "nav-link active" aria-current="page" href="">Home</a>
                    <a class = "nav-link" href="">Login</a> 
                </nav>
            </div>
        </header>

            (b) - Also update the main and footer tag 

                        <main class="px-3">
            <h2>Find a deal near you!</h2>
            <p class="lead">Looking to buy or sell a used car? We've got you
                covered. </br> AutoMax is the leading used car marketplace.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                <a href="" class="btn btn-lg btn-secondary fw-bold border-white bg-white">Register</a>
            </p>
        </main> 
        <footer class="mt-auto text-white-50">
            <p>Copyright Â© {% now 'Y' %} <a href="" class="text-white">AutoMax</a> by <a href="https://preneure.com"
                    class="text-white">lucifersfier.com</a></p>
        </footer>

            (c) - after that we are finished with the main page of our website.

##########################  DJANGO AUTHENTICATION  ##########################

Creating users in our application means register users and have the ability for users to log in and then manage the 
data that's associated with users such as maybe their bio profile, picture address and things like that.


1) - Create Users Django APP ---->>>>

            (a) - we are now going to use startapp command
                  our focus is going to be make sure that we create an app that is going to basically decouple the 
                  authentication logic of our application into its own distinct app

                  python  manage.py startapp users 
            (b) - AutoMax >> AutoMax >> settings.py >> INSTALLED APPS after main add users string

2) - Creating Profile Model ---->>>>

            (a) - creating users in our web admin panel, and then basically how we can extend the functionaity.
            (b) - creating a new model which is basically a profile model for the user it will act as an extension of 
                  the user which basically save additional data regarding that user.
            (c) - for that i am going into 
                                          users >> models.py >> here we create profile model
            (d) - Now first creating a relationship between profile and the user.
            (e) - Now we have created our profile and we need to migrate it.
            (f) - And then apply migration to the database.
            (g) - In terminal run python manage.py makemigrations
            (h) - Now apply the migrations -->>
                                                in terminal python manage.py migrate

3) - Django Admin Register Model ---->>>>

            (a) - users >> admin.py >> 
                                    from .models import Profile

                  '''i am going to basically create a class which i am going to call profile admin '''
                  #register function register the model for the admin panel so that the admin panel doesn't displays it.
                                                            class ProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
                                                                  pass

                                                            admin.site.register(Profile, ProfileAdmin)

4) - Working with Django Signals ---->>>>

            I would like to automate the process whereby when a user gets created in our application that it profile 
            automatically gets created for them to achieve this functionality what we're going to be doing is that we're 
            going to be using a concept in general known as signals 
            Signals are basically a way for us to get notified if some certain action happens on our database, and 
            depending upon that action we can perform other actions.

            users -->> create signals.py file
