1) - Django has a built in ORM and the object is a object relational mapper 
2) - It's a bascially a system whereby it abstarcts away the complexities of interacting with the SQL database and the ORM allows 
us to basically write python code which in turn can interact with the SQL database all on its own.
3) - What happens when we have those SQL code made by python or made by Django ?
ANS: We need to do is that we need to instruct the Django framework that, hey, the migrationsthat have been made, you need to apply 
these to database so that the database typically updates the schema and knows how to interact with our application.

4) - A migration is basically the python code that we write to interact with our database.
5) - Django Admin app or django admin clay tool is a tool that is provided to us by the django package that we install and we only use 
     that to actually start or create our initial projectand after that I just switch to using the managae that profile because it contains all
     of the functionalitythat I would require from the Django admin as well as some additional feature as well.
6) - ASGI file is bascially the file that stands for Asynchronous Server gateway Interface and it allows external applications and that act as web servers 
     to basically interactwith our Django application or service.
7) - WSGI file is use when we actually deploy our application to production.
8) - We're basically going to be doing is that we are basically going to be using the manage.py clay and we're going to be using that to be 
     basically create a super user for our application.
9) - A super user in the case just means a user which has admin privileages for our application which has a role of admin and the managed.py CLA 
     tool basically has some functionality in that allows us to do that.
